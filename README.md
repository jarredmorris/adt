# Description
An (incomplete) collection of data structures and algorithms used to support the backend of a Twitter-like web app for a university 

Note that this collection is intentionally incomplete. It is intended to provide a snapshot of the activities I performed when creating the data structures to supplement the back-end of a Twitter-like web app. 

This source does NOT include the actual classes that "slotted into" that web application where a lot of the more complicated logic came into place, and is where these data structures were actually used. Unfortunately this is a necesarry step to prevent plagiarism as the university assignment that this work was created for may still be in use. Some methods have been removed or altered to return different results for the same reason. 

A full version of my work can be viewed at request, in person.
